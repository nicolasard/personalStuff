### The complete overview to monitor a server
Grana needs a "Data Source" that it's used to show the data from. One good datasource will be InfluxDB, a time series database. If you want to monitor the Ram memmory in different servers for example, this DB should be populated with a "Time series collector" like Telegraph.





#### To install InfluxDB
Download the linux binary from InfluxData https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads/ (Influx Data it's the company behind Influx)
