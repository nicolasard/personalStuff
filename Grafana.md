### Installing Grafana

Ass you know I love install standalone applications, so this will be my guid about how to install Grafana in a standalone.

*Environment:* Virtualiced Debian Linux

1. Download Grafana binaries from https://grafana.com/grafana/download

2. 


### The complete overview to monitor a server
Grana needs a "Data Source" that it's used to show the data from. One good datasource will be InfluxDB, a time series database. If you want to monitor the Ram memmory in different servers for example, this DB should be populated with a "Time series collector" like Telegraph.





#### To install InfluxDB
Download the linux binary from InfluxData https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads/ (Influx Data it's the company behind Influx)

Influx DB it's like a SQL database for time series. 

>Conceptually you can think of a measurement as an SQL table, where the primary index is always time. tags and fields are effectively >columns in the table. tags are indexed, and fields are not. The difference is that, with InfluxDB, you can have millions of >measurements, you don’t have to define schemas up-front, and null values aren’t stored.

```bash
