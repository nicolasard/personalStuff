## Playing with Kubernates in MS Azure

The kubernates guide that I'm following can be found in https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/scratch/#downloading-and-extracting-kubernetes-binaries

Once we have a VM running, we need to download the kubernates binaries from https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.11.8
