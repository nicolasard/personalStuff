## SpringBatch

SpringBatch it's a feature (Or sub-framework) of Spring to do batch processing. I started to use it at my first work in Prisma Medios de Pagos. At that time I wrote this https://github.com/nicolasard/SpringBatchStuff repository with examples about how to use it. 

It' was always usefull to check the examples from Michael Minella github repos. (He is one of the main architects of SpringBatch).
